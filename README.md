# Animal Crossing Villager Analysis

This is a simple population analysis project that examines specific aspects of the villagers found in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The population includes any base-game villagers that a player can receive. 
This means that collaboration villagers, such as the Sanrio villagers, are not included, nor are the upcoming The Legend of Zelda villagers or Splatoon villagers. 
Special visitors and shopkeeping villagers are also excluded (so no Tom Nook, Able Sisters, Flick, C.J., etc.).

The CSV file used was converted from an Excel sheet I made of the different villagers. All the information for the villagers was obtained from the [ACNH Travel Guide app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acnh-travel-guide/id1502818559) by Jeffrey. 
The collected data includes villagers' names, species, genders, personalities, and hobbies. A copy of the CSV file is included in the repository.

So without further ado, let's look at some charts!

## Visualizations

One thing to note is that since all the data collected was categorical, all the charts created for this project are bar charts or variations of bar charts. 

### Population Counts

The following charts show a breakdown of the different counts of each villager aspect. 

#### Gender

First and foremost is the breakdown of villagers gender.
